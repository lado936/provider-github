## Developing

To add a new resource follow these steps:
1. Run `make submodules` to initialize the "build" Make submodule we use for CI/CD.
2. Add your new type by running the following command:
```shell
  export group=sample # lower case e.g. core, cache, database, storage, etc.
  export type=MyType # Camel casee.g. Bucket, Database, CacheCluster, etc.
  make provider.addtype provider=GitHub group=${group} kind=${type}
```
3. Call the `Setup` function of your controller here `internal/controller/github.go`
4. Run `make run` to run locally
5. Run `make reviewable` to run code generation, linters, and tests.
6. Run `make build` to build the provider.
